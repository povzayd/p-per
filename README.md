Forensic Imaging and Video Reconstruction Toolkit aka p-per (peeperüëÄ)

This toolkit is a unified suite of Python-based tools engineered for extracting visual evidence from raw binary files, PCAP captures, memory dumps, and more. It is ideal for digital forensic analysts, red/blue teamers, malware analysts, or CTF participants working on uncovering embedded image data and converting it into meaningful, analyzable video intelligence.

The toolkit is modular, terminal-friendly, and supports AI-powered image classification, metadata logging, face anonymization, and motion analysis.

MODULE 1: JPEG Extraction from Binary Files ‚Äì pcap2img.py

Purpose:

This script performs a deep scan of binary or media files to recover embedded JPEG images. It works by identifying JPEG start (0xFFD8) and end (0xFFD9) markers in the binary data using regular expressions.

Use Cases:

Recovery of deleted or hidden image files from raw memory dumps

Extracting evidence from file dumps in malware or ransomware cases

CTF tasks involving steganography or binary analysis


Key Features:

Supports various binary and media formats: .bin, .dat, .raw, .mp4, .avi, .mov, .jpg, .jpeg

Extracted images are saved in a clean, structured output directory

Uses tqdm for visual progress bars

Leverages prompt_toolkit for enhanced command-line interaction

Logs all actions and handles exceptions gracefully


Requirements:
```
pip install tqdm prompt_toolkit
```
Usage:
```
python pcap2img.py
```
You will be prompted:
```
üîç Enter your file name:
```
Output:

A folder named after the input file (without extension), containing all frame_XXXX.jpg files

Each image is saved sequentially based on its offset in the binary


Example Run:
```
$ python jpeg_extractor.py
üîç Enter your file name: disk_dump.bin
üìÇ Output directory created: 'disk_dump'
üì∏ Extracting images: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 8/8
‚úÖ Success! Extracted 8 JPEG images to 'disk_dump'
```
Limitations:

Does not validate JPEG file structure beyond the header and footer signatures

May produce corrupted or incomplete files if JPEGs are fragmented

MODULE 2: Advanced JPEG Extraction + AI Classification ‚Äì pcap2imgv2.py

Purpose:

This is an enhanced version of pcap2img.py, supporting high-performance chunked reading for large files and AI-based classification of the extracted images using pretrained MobileNetV2.

Ideal For:

Analysts dealing with multi-gigabyte PCAPs or dumps

Automatic triage and tagging of image types

Prioritizing extracted data using AI prediction


Key Features:

Chunked binary parsing (1MB blocks) to reduce memory usage

Optional AI classification (--classify) using MobileNetV2 from PyTorch‚Äôs torchvision.models

Optional ZIP compression of output (--zip)

Clean CLI interface with argparse and logging

Customizable output directory and structured reporting


Requirements:
```
pip install torch torchvision pillow tqdm
```
Optional: Use a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build for GPU acceleration.

Usage:
```
python3 pcap2imgv2.py -i <input_file> [-o <output_dir>] [--zip] [--classify]
```
Command-Line Arguments:
```
Argument        Description

-i, --input     Path to the input binary (required)
-o, --output    Output directory (default: <input>_frames)
--zip   Compress the output folder into a .zip file
--classify      Run AI classification on extracted images
```

Example Runs:
```
python3 pcap2imgv2.py -i traffic.pcap
```
```
python3 pcap2imgv2.py -i dump.bin --zip
```
```
python3 pcap2imgv2.py -i memory_dump.raw --classify
```
```
python3 pcap2imgv2.py -i data.pcap -o ./output_frames
```

AI Classification Output:
```
üß† frame_0021.jpg ‚Üí "laptop"
üß† frame_0022.jpg ‚Üí "zebra"
```
Performance Logging:
```

Limitations:

Only supports JPEG recovery (FFD8 to FFD9)

ImageNet-trained classifier may mislabel specialized forensics content

Damaged frames may fail classification

MODULE 3: Forensic Video Generator ‚Äì videogen.py

Purpose:

Converts a sequence of images (from folder or .zip) into a forensic-grade MP4 video with optional overlays including timestamps, face anonymization, OCR metadata, motion detection, and heatmap generation.

Limitations:

Relies on consistent timestamp metadata for sequencing

Motion detection is basic and may flag minor shifts

OCR and face detection can add processing overhead

Here‚Äôs a detailed section you can include in your README or documentation to describe the motion heatmap feature:


---

Motion Heatmap

The motion heatmap is a visual representation of movement detected across a sequence of frames. It highlights areas with consistent or intense activity, helping forensic analysts quickly identify regions of interest.

How It Works

1. Frame Differencing:
The tool computes the difference between consecutive grayscale frames to detect pixel-level motion.


2. Binary Threshold + Dilation:
Changes are thresholded and dilated to emphasize moving regions.


3. Accumulation:
A mask is accumulated over time‚Äîeach motion-detected area increases pixel intensity in a separate heatmap matrix.


4. Color Mapping:
After processing all frames, the accumulated motion matrix is converted into a heatmap using OpenCV‚Äôs COLORMAP_JET, turning motion intensity into a color gradient (blue = low, red = high activity).



Output

A file named *_heatmap.jpg is saved in the output directory when --motion-highlight is enabled.

If `--preview-heatmap` is set, the heatmap is also displayed after rendering.


Example Use Case
```

python videogen9.py ./security_images.zip --motion-highlight --preview-heatmap
```
This will:

Draw motion boxes on the video frames

Generate and preview a heatmap showing movement zones over time


Interpretation

‚Ä¢ Red zones = high motion activity

‚Ä¢ Blue/green zones = minimal or no activity


This is especially useful for:
```
Surveillance analysis

Intruder detection

Behavior monitoring in forensic investigations

```
